            <h1>About <span>Barbarian</span></h1>
            <h3>Power of Barbarian</h3>
            <p>Barbarians have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the Barbarians will proceed to attack the nearest structure.

                <h3>The Barbarian King is stronger & more aggressive</h3>
                <p>The Barbarian King is an immortal unit (since he is a hero), so he only has to be summoned once. However, if he is injured or gets defeated in an attack, he must regenerate his health by sleeping for a period of time before he can be used again.</p>

                <h2>Raged Barbarian</h2>
                <h3>Why is he so angry, speedy, and vicious? </h3>
                <p>Raged Barbarian may be thought of as a Barbarian from Builder Base; he behaves similar to a normal Barbarian. However, when he is upgraded to level 2 or higher, his special ability (Rage) is unlocked and his speed and damage are increased for the first few seconds after deployment.</p>
